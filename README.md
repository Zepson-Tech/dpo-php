   $order = [
            'paymentAmount'=>"10000",

            'customerFirstName'=> "Novath",
            'customerLastName'=> "Thomas",
            'customerAddress'=> "Tanzania",
             'customerCity'=>"Dodoma",
            'customerPhone'=> "0752771650",
            'customerEmail'=> "novath@zepson.co.tz",
            'companyRef'=> "34TESTREFF"
        ];
    //Now make  payment
    $dpo->directPayment($data);
    //Its done!  Simple right!ðŸ˜‚

```

## Installation

Install the package Via Composer 
```sh
    composer require zepson/dpo-php
```

## USAGE
- create array of your order which match  parrameters in the following exaple
```php
$order = [
            'paymentAmount'=>"10000",
            'paymentCurrency'=> "TZS",
            'customerFirstName'=> "Novath",
            'customerLastName'=> "Thomas",
            'customerAddress'=> "Tanzania",
             'customerCity'=>"Dodoma",
            'customerPhone'=> "0752771650",
            'customerEmail'=> "novath@zepson.co.tz",
            'companyRef'=> "34TESTREFF"
        ];
```
- Now you can choose to make direct payment or createToken First and then make payment
- Starting with Direct Payment
```php
   $dpo = new Dpo;
   return $dpo->directPayment($data); //this will redirect user to DPO Payment page
 ```
 - If you preffer to save details then this is the ideal step to follow [Generate Token, Make payment]
 - Get Token
 ```php
       $token = $dpo->createToken($data); //return array of response with transaction code
       //you can save or do what ever you want with the response
```
- Get payment Url
```php
    $dpo->getPaymentUrl($token);
```
- Redirect User to payment page
```php
   return Redirect::to($payment_url);
```

As [Novath Thomas] always says

> There is a huge difference between sysem security and
>complications, Complication hurts, API should'nt be complicated
>Thats one of the primary AIM of the introduction of APIs
